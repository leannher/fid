<h2>My Bio</h2>
<p>When I was little, I loved to draw and build things. I was encouraged by the people in my life 
to improve. But there was a time when I stopped enjoying art and music. After a while I 
regained my appreciation for art and decided to pursue it in college. It was a difficult 
transition and at first, I was burnt out and tired of all the work. But slowly I’m becoming more 
used to receiving all this information. Now I’m still learning more and more about the things I love, 
and I’ll probably never stop finding things to learn about. </p>
